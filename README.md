Technical Task for 12id.
Miro board with some extra information, my process etc (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPT21M4k=/?share_link_id=137232885320)

I tried to make sure that each function handles one task which means that there are more lines of code,
but for the puropse of showing my train of thought I decided that way to be better.

My process:
it's been a while since I completed similar task, so it took me a while finding the right solutions and splitting up the
funcitonality into manageable bits.

Assumptions and thoughts:

using "Example: AB1, AC4, AD10, BE3, CD4, CF2, DE1, EB3, EA2, FD1" as possible inputs, all calculations will be based on them

CASE 1:
User can choose the route by selecting buttons with coresponding cities,
value is saved to an array and outputted underneath, updated with each click

reset button to clear the array

finding the best way of saving the result and comparing it with possible routes
once I found a way to check which pairs match,
compare created pairs with matching set to check if the whole route is possible
if not:
return "route not possible"
if yes:
add the costs together and return them

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
