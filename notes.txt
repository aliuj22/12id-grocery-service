I tried to make sure that each function handles one task which means that there are more lines of code, 
but for the puropse of showing my train of thought I decided that way to be better.

My process: 
it's been a while since I completed similar task, so it took me a while finding the right solutions and splitting up the 
funcitonality into manageable bits. 


Assumptions and thoughts:

using "Example: AB1, AC4, AD10, BE3, CD4, CF2, DE1, EB3, EA2, FD1" as possible inputs, all calculations will be based on them 

CASE 1: 
User can choose the route by selecting buttons with coresponding cities,
value is saved to an array and outputted underneath, updated with each click

reset button to clear the array

finding the best way of saving the result and comparing it with possible routes
once I found a way to check which pairs match, 
compare created pairs with matching set to check if the whole route is possible
if not:
return "route not possible"
if yes: 
add the costs together and return them
