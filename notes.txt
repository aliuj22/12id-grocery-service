Assumptions and thoughts:

using "Example: AB1, AC4, AD10, BE3, CD4, CF2, DE1, EB3, EA2, FD1" as possible inputs, all calculations will be based on them 

all three cases will be treated separately with separate input fields

CASE 1: 
User can choose the route by selecting buttons with coresponding cities,
value is saved to an array and outputted underneath, updated with each click

reset button to clear the array


finding the best way of saving the result and comparing it with possible routes
once I found a way to check which pairs match, 
compare created pairs with matching set to check if the whole route is possible
if not:
return "route not possible"
if yes: 
add the costs together and return them
