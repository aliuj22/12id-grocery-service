Assumptions and thoughts:

using "Example: AB1, AC4, AD10, BE3, CD4, CF2, DE1, EB3, EA2, FD1" as possible inputs, all calculations will be based on them 

all three cases will be treated separately with separate input fields

CASE 1: 
User can choose the route by selecting buttons with coresponding cities,
value is saved to an array and outputted underneath, updated with each click

reset button to clear the array
